# Dawnlight Dev's Developer Blog

The repository for my personal blog website, currently hosted on Netlify! This site is programmed using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript with the jQuery library for added functionality. This is my personal blog where I will be uploading blog posts relating to projects I'm currently developing and working on, such as my 2D indie JRPG game, <i>Mahou Shoujo Monogatari</i>

## About The Developer
My name is Dawnlight, also known as Dawnlight Dev or by my old Twitter handle, DawnlightDGArle. I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Maine at Farmington and am in my 4th year of my degree program. I wish to go to grad school to get my PhD in Computer Science so I can become a Professor of Computer Science at a university somewhere in the future, but for now, I'm just a simple developer working on various cool projects and honing my skills in the software engineering world! As for why I created my blog, well it was so that I could practice my technical writing skills in the form of devlogs! I plan on using my site to post various articles about the various projects I'm working on (and perhaps do something in correlation with YouTube later) and to further document my ongoing journey into the world of Computer Science!

If you happen to like the design of my website or like some of the functionality in my site, feel free to sample from my repository (with credit of course if you use a lot of my code). I would be quite humbled if my blog inspired you to create your own!
