    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Well, I'm Destiny!</h3>
    <div id = "about">
    On the internet, I go by the username DawnlightDev (or sometimes just Dawnlight). I'm a 21 year old Computer Science and Mathematics undergraduate
        with a major passion for all aspects of Computer Science, but mostly in software engineering and design, as well as having a passion 
        for various topics in Mathematics such as Algebra and Calculus. I work part-time as a MySQL database developer working on a Chinese pinyin 
        dictionary database and also tutor the underclassmen in introductory computer science courses at my university. I'm a hobbyist game developer
        playing with C# and Godot and I have a vision to create and release my dream game at some point in my Computer Science career. My goal in
        Computer Science is to become a professor, so once I am done with my Bachelor's, I plan on going to graduate school to get my PhD.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    I primarily work with Java, C# and Python on a near daily basis, but I have dabbled in other languages like JavaScript, Ruby, Lisp and PHP. I have certifications
        in Responsive Web Design and Foundational C# and am always more than willing to share my knowledge of Computer Science with anyone who will listen.
